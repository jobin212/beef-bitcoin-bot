 ## How to run 
 - Create a .env file in the root directory with your twitter app credentials (see .env.example for skeleton)
 - go run .
 
 ## Data sources
 - Bitcoin: https://www.blockchain.info/ticker
 - Beef: 
    - Costco ribeye is $10.99 
    - Considering using: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PBEEFUSDM which has nominal US prices
        - This is per pound data, so then perhaps we'd multiply by the average weight of a cow?

## TODO
- Create beef price over time chart
-
